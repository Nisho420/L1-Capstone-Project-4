# L1-Capstone-Project-4
The task at hand for this capstone project:
- Create a Python program that will read from the text ﬁle inventory.txt and
perform the following on the data, to prepare for presentation to your
managers:
- Create a ﬁle named inventory.py, where a Shoe class should be deﬁned.
- In the Shoe class, create a function (**read_data()**) that will
implement a try-except block for reading the following information
from the ﬁle:
  - country,
  - code,
  - product,
  - cost, and
  - quantity.
- Create at least 5 shoe objects and store these in a list. Add
functionality to search products in the objects list by code.
- Write code to determine the product with the lowest quantity, and
restock it.
- Write code to determine the product with the highest quantity and
mark it up as being for sale.
- You will have noticed that in the original data, there are only ﬁve
columns. Write a function, **value_per_item()**, to calculate the value
(or total worth) of each item entered. This function should then
create a sixth column for each product, named value.
- Represent the data from the objects list in a table format using
Python’s tabulate module, with the new value column added.
